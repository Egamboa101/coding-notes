# Data Types

- String "String" // You can use backticks (`), double quotations ("), or single quotations (') interchangebly
- Number 3423423
- Array [123, text, ]
- Boolean (True/False)
- Object {
  name: "Marcus",
  age: 27,
  spouse: {  
   }
  }

If I want to see if something is working then use console.log() to test and see the results of the code.

Variable names can't start with a number or have spaces in them.

# Declare Data Types

- let name = "Marcus";
  let keyword means you can change the data
  or
- const age = 27;
  const keyword means you can't change the data

Old way to declare used var, which is equivalent to "let" essentially.

# Functions

To define but not invoke:

function functionName(){
//...insert function steps
}

New ES6 syntax

//when there's a parameter in the parenthesis you're telling the function to do something with that. When defining the function you generally don't list a defined variable in the parenthesis.
const functionName = (x) => {

}


To invoke 
functionName(insert variable)


If you want your function to give you something back you use the return statement.
